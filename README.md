# donut

Simple simulation of a donut excitation PSF scanned circularly around a molecule position.
`scandonut` writes the intensities at the molecule position during scanning to a text file.
The data can be plotted using a simple python script.

To compile the code under unix, run `cmake .` and `make`. Boost tests can be run using `make test`.
